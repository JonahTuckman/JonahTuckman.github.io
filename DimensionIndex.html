                <p> My name is Jonah Tuckman. I am currently in my junior year at Vassar College majoring in Computer Science alongside correlates in Statistical Mathematics and Quantitative Economics.</p>
                <br>
                <p> I am passionate about the possibilities that predictive algorithms and the usage of data present us with. There are many global issues present which I feel solutions exist through the usage of data and Machine Learning practices including cancer detection, stock market prediction and handfuls of others</p>
