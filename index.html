									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p> My name is Jonah Tuckman and I am a Co-Founder and the CEO & President of eBumps. We are a new and exciting startup company in the tech space with the goal of allowing the everyday user to monetize their space in a way not currently possible. Alongside my Co-Founders, we have built eBumps from an idea spoken of over text to a funded company on its way to market. </p>
	                <br>
                    <p> Personally, I am passionate about the ways that technology can solve global issues that we are faced with daily. I have worked as a software developer for years in my schooling, past jobs, and free time. This allowed me to understand the tech space in depth and from there combine my technical mind with my knowledge of the world in an often overlooked combination.   </p>
									<br>
                                    <p> I do an excellent job of understand the society that we live in both at the high-level of an avid reader and at the low-level of an engineer.  </p>
