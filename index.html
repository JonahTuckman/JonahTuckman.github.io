									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p> My name is Jonah Tuckman and I am a Co-Founder and CEO of eBumps. We are a new and exciting startup company in the AdTech space with the goal of allowing the everyday driver a way to monetize their space, something not currently possible for them today. We have built eBumps from an idea spoken of in hypotheticals to a funded company, released within the NYC market
										 with operational screens built by some of the best manufacturers in the world, and revenues from both individual advertisers and larger agencies. </p>
	                <br>
                    <p> Personally, I am passionate about the ways that technology can solve global issues that we are faced with daily, in the case of eBumps I hope to allow further payment systems into the lives of those who have for so long recieved low wages for the driving they are doing (rideshare drivers, taxi drivers, gig-economy drivers and more). </p>
											<br>
											Prior to founding eBumps and beginnig to work on the executive side of building a startup, I had worked as a software developer for years alongside a variety of different startups. This allowed me to understand the tech space in depth on the techincal front as well as through the details of startup businesses that I had observed over time.   </p>
									<br>
                                    <p> I do an excellent job of building teams around me that produce the highest grade of work possible while also feeling comfortable and happy in the job that they are doing. Similarly, I understand how to build a business or a product to function such that it will be accepted into the desired space on release which I have done for years now.   </p>

									<h2>Projects</h2>
									<p> <b> 2019: BlockPush.io</b>*  Contracted by the Founder and CEO of blockpush.io to lead and manage the remote development team of the company as well as build an AI platform needed for the advancement of the product. </p>
                                    <br>
									<p><b> 2019: OverRule </b> Led a small team at FBL in the creation of overrule.io. A decentralized advertising platform which allows users to create encrypted wallets for domains and pledge funds into these wallets.
														The wallet which has the highest sum each hour will have our domain route users to their website homepage thus serving as excellent advertisement when foot trafﬁc increases. </p>
																		<br>
									<p><b> 2019: BigCT.biz</b>* Advised on and led a team through full end to end development of the decentralized application needed to the BIGCT.biz platform. Total control of product design including architecture decisions, development features, and more. </p>
																		<br>
									<p> <b> 2018: Is Tesla A Car Company? </b> As a fun side project I training predictive models determining a rise or fall in stock price based on collections of car and tech companies with Tesla being the target variable.
														I had compared Tesla's predicted values to true values over this time and then used accuracy rates to determine the more representative portfolio for Tesla to be a part of. In my ﬁndings, although technically Tesla manufactures vehicles, its proper portfolio to be considered in is the grouping of Tech companies. </p>
																		<br>
									<p> <b> 2018: Chat Bot </b> I trained and manipulated a Chat Bot using Machine Learning practices alongside a database of screenplays (Cornell Movie Dialogue Corpus dataset, the perfect thing to use in terms of a database of written conversatoins).  These scripts comprised of ﬁctional, movie script dialogues that built up my training data. </p>
																		<br>
									<p> <b> 2018: The Phone Game </b> I consulted and assisted on the development of Swift Code and the overall creation of this mobile experiment as a favor to a friend and employer. The game was built around one's tendency to check their phone during dinner. All players (meal atendees) would enter into a game lobby though the app
										 and decide on a wager for the round then place their phones face down, the first to flip their phone over to look would be detected by the app and thus they would lose and be responsible for the wager to the other players. </p>
