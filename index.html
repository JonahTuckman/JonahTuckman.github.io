									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p> My name is Jonah Tuckman. I am currently in my third year at Vassar College majoring in Computer Science alongside a correlate in Statistical Mathematics.</p>
	                <br>
	                <p> I am passionate about uncovering the potential of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence practices in addressing and solving global issues and drawing this into collaboration with secure and protected Blockchain technology.
											Alongside the emergence of Blockchain, I see a world where personalized data belongs solely to the user, yet broad and anonymous data allows us to solve global issues such as cancer detection and treatments, renewable energy practices, autonomous automobiles, and many more. </p>

									<h2>Projects</h2>
									<p> <b> 2019: Senior Software Engineer </b>  I am one of two Senior Software Engineers at Fitzner Blockchain Consulting, thus I am in charge of leading and building projects, making decisions of architectures used, and all other aspects of development projects.
										<br> At Fitzner Blockchain Consulting we work on a variety of different internal and external projects.
										<br> Internally we are building tools to aid the needs of the company such as web crawlers and data analyzers.
												<br> Externally we are contracted by clients to produce development projects such as decentralized web and mobile applications and demos.
															The development side of this includes front end engineering and UX design as well as the building of smart contracts.
												<br>I also advise clients on their high-level architectures and token choices in their early stages of development planning.
 												<br> Under the subset of Fitzner Blockchain Consulting, Fitzner Labs, I am developing projects alongside a small team working on both the creative design and the physical development, deployment and maintenance of projects sparking from our minds.  </p>
                                    <br>
									<p> <b> 2018: Is Tesla A Car Company? </b> I am training predictive models determining a rise or fall in stock price based on collections of car and tech companies with Tesla being the target variable. I am comparing Tesla predicted values to true values over this time and using accuracy rates found to determine the more representative portfolio for Tesla to be a part of. In my ﬁndings this is the grouping of Tech companies. </p>
									<br>
									<p> <b> 2018: Chat Bot </b> I trained and manipulated a Chat Bot using Machine Learning practices. Training the Bot using Cornell Movie Dialogue Corpus dataset comprising of ﬁctional, movie script dialogues as training data. </p>
									<br>
									<p> <b> 2018: The Phone Game </b> I consulted and assisted on the development of Swift Code and the overall creation of this mobile experiment as a favor to a friend and employer. </p>
